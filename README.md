# Investment Calculator
This is the first GUI I made with wxWidgets. It is a future value calculator. You enter an investment amount, the numbers years for the investment and the monthly interest rate and the calculator returns the future value.

## App
This is the start of the app.

## MainFrame
This contains the widgets of the calculator.

## FutureValue
This is the class responsible for performing future value calculcations.
